To properly test the authentication status:

1. First visit http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/google in your browser to complete the Google login
2. After successful login, you can check your authentication status at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/status
3. Make sure your browser includes the session cookies when making the status request
The status endpoint will return the authentication state and user details if you're properly logged in.
